# CMPG323 Project 4
The goal of project 4 is to test the CRUD functionality of the Connected Office Web App and automating the process of testing. 


## How to use the report
The user will run a process that will input test data into the web application and test the CRUD results. It returns whether the CRUD operations are functional by stating true or false in the excel sheet. This way the user will know whether a CRUD operation in the web app is working or not and whether anything needs to be fixed.
